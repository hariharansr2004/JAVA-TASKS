 * Abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects.
 * It can be only accessed and inherited from another class
 * abstract class must at-least contains one abstract method
 * abstract method does not have any body
 * we can leave abstract method without defining it but we can't leave normal methods like that 
 * we should define the normal method and we can also use normal method in a abstract class
 * we can indirectly create objects for abstract method by extending it
 * in interface only we write methods inside
